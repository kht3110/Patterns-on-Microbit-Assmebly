## Assets

This folder should contain all images that you want to include in your report.

For example, if we have a file called `cpu.png` inside this folder, then to include it in the report, you 
would use the following line in your `report.md`:

```
![CPU Image](assets/cpu.png)
```

More generally, the format is:

```
![Image Description](path/to/image.png)
```
